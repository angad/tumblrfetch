My first hands-on with Google App Engine

Input the name of the tumblr blog. for e.g. startupquote
and enter the number of pages up to which you want the images to be extracted from.
Click on get. 

The next page shows you all the images extracted from the blog. Works only for PNG for now. Save the page and you will have all the images.
